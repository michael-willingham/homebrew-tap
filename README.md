# Michael's Homebrew Tap

This was created because the public cask manifest for NetLogo (as of January 2026) is invalid. This is the only cask in here for now. In the future, I may add personal projects to this tap for macOS distribution!

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install michael-willingham/tap/<formula>`

Or `brew tap michael-willingham/tap` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or, in a `brew bundle` `Brewfile`:

```ruby
tap "michael-willingham/tap"
brew "<formula>"
```

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
